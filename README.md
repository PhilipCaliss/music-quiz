# Music-Quiz

A set of simple scripts for creating a music quiz using Spotify and ChatGPT.

## Requirements

Before you start, ensure you have the following:
- A registered app in the Spotify Developer Dashboard: [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
- An OpenAI API key, with credits loaded.
- A Spotify subscription. Note: All participants also need a Spotify subscription.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Necessary Packages

First, install the required packages by running:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Configure Application Secrets

- Replace the values in `secrets.txt` for `CLIENT_ID`, `CLIENT_SECRET`, and the OpenAI API key. You can obtain `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` from your app registration in the Spotify Developer Dashboard.

### 3. Register Participants

- Since this is a development app and not published, all participants need to be registered in the Spotify Developer Dashboard.

### 4. Run the Main Script

1. Execute `main.py` by running:

```bash
python main.py
```

2. Copy the URL generated by the script into a web browser and instruct participants (one at a time) to log in and approve the application. You'll encounter an error message afterward, but simply copy the URL from the browser and paste it back into the terminal that's awaiting the response.

3. Repeat this step for all participants.

After completing these steps, you should have two files: `chatgpt_responses.csv` and `top_tracks.csv`.

### 5. Create the Spotify Playlist

Finally, run `run.py` to create a Spotify playlist containing all the tracks from `top_tracks.csv`. Execute:
```bash
python run.py
```
